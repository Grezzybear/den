This started as me just exploring docker compose and organizing my media so I started writing all these somewhat manually.
Eventually once i had something kinda working I ended up finding [EZARR](https://github.com/Luctia/ezarr/tree/main) which was basically everything I wanted to put together and more. I started adapting what I had already with the guidance of this other repository, largely with the setup.sh to initialize users, folder structure, and permissions. Many of these structural choices come from the [Servarr Wiki](https://wiki.servarr.com/docker-guide) which has great suggestions on how to set things up. The guide on hardlinks from [TRaSH](https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/) also helped greatly.

Another great repo that helped me along was [Cloud-Reverse-Proxy](https://github.com/N-Quan/Cloud-Reverse-Proxy) from [N-Quan](https://github.com/N-Quan). I was having many issues finding out the correct iptables rules for forwarding traffic from a cloud VPS through wireguard, so this knowledge was invaluable.
